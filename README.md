# Bayesian-Structural-Time-Series-BSTS-vs-ARIMA-Models-for-Sales-Forecasting

In this repository, I wanted to compare Bayesian Structural Time Series (BSTS) model vs traditional time series model ARIMA for Sales Forecasting.

The first notebook compares these two models with generated sales data.

The second notebook compares BSTS and ARIMA models, by using Online Retail Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which is available at the following [link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00352/Online%20Retail.xlsx);
